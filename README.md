# Learn PyTorch
My coursework from [learnpytorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io).

| Section | What does it cover? |
|---|---|
| [00 - PyTorch Fundamentals](https://github.com/KC-7/learn-pytorch/blob/main/00_pytorch_fundamentals.ipynb) | Many fundamental PyTorch operations used for deep learning and neural networks. |
| [01 - PyTorch Workflow](https://github.com/KC-7/learn-pytorch/blob/main/01_pytorch_workflow.ipynb) | Provides an outline for approaching deep learning problems and building neural networks with PyTorch. |
| 02 - PyTorch Neural Network Classification | Uses the PyTorch workflow from 01 to go through a neural network classification problem. |
| 03 - PyTorch Computer Vision | Let's see how PyTorch can be used for computer vision problems using the same workflow from 01 & 02. |
| 04 - PyTorch Custom Datasets | How do you load a custom dataset into PyTorch? Also we'll be laying the foundations in this notebook for our modular code (covered in 05). |
| 05 - PyTorch Going Modular | PyTorch is designed to be modular, let's turn what we've created into a series of Python scripts (this is how you'll often find PyTorch code in the wild). |
| 06 - PyTorch Transfer Learning | Let's take a well performing pre-trained model and adjust it to one of our own problems. |
| 07 - Milestone Project 1: PyTorch Experiment Tracking | We've built a bunch of models... wouldn't it be good to track how they're all going? |
| 08 - Milestone Project 2: PyTorch Paper Replicating | PyTorch is the most popular deep learning framework for machine learning research, let's see why by replicating a machine learning paper. |
| 09 - Milestone Project 3: Model Deployment | So we've built a working PyTorch model... how do we get it in the hands of others? Hint: deploy it to the internet. |
